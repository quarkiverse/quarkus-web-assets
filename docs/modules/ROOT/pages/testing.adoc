= Quarkus image:logo.svg[width=25em] Web Bundler - Testing

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

== With end-to-end testing

The Web Bundler is a really good fit with e2e testing using extensions such as https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-playwright/dev/index.html[Quarkus Playwright]. This way you can very easilly test your full-stack application as a box and taking advantage of all the Quarkus dev services.

Example:
[source,java]
----
@QuarkusTest
@WithPlaywright
public class WithDefaultPlaywrightTest {

    @InjectPlaywright
    BrowserContext context;

    @TestHTTPResource("/")
    URL index;

    @Test
    public void testIndex() {
        final Page page = context.newPage();
        Response response = page.navigate(index.toString());
        Assertions.assertEquals("OK", response.statusText());

        page.waitForLoadState();

        String title = page.title();
        Assertions.assertEquals("My Awesome App", title);

        // Make sure the web app is loaded and hits the backend
        final ElementHandle quinoaEl = page.waitForSelector(".toast-body.received");
        String greeting = quinoaEl.innerText();
        Assertions.assertEquals("Hello from RESTEasy Reactive", greeting);
    }
}

== With UI component testing

It is currently https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-web-bundler/issues/110#issuecomment-1821501878[not possible to run javascript tests] with the Web Bundler.

If you want to do UI component testing with Quarkus, here two solutions:

* Switch to https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-quinoa/[Quinoa] as it will allow to use the NPM ecosystem for testing.
* Extract components which need to be tested in a npm published library, then you can use it from the web bundler through https://mvnpm.org[mvnpm.org].
