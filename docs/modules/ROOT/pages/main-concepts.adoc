== How it works

It's really simple, the web bundler:

image:web-bundler.png[Web Bundler schema]


1. Takes/watches your web resources and <<web-dependencies>>.

2. Bundles it with the supersonic esbuild compiler (scss are also compiled if needed) and serves them.

3. Make it easy to create pages (.html) with the bundle scripts and styles xref:advanced-guides.adoc#bundle-paths[using Qute or any other template engine].

[#web-dependencies]
== Web Dependencies

Once xref:advanced-guides.adoc#web-dependencies[added in the pom.xml] the dependencies are directly available through import from the scripts and styles:

.app.js
[source,javascript]
----
import $ from 'jquery';

$('.hello').innerText('Hello');
----

Imported dependencies scripts and styles will be bundled.

WARNING: Only imported dependencies (scripts and styles) will be bundled, dead code will be eliminated during the build.
